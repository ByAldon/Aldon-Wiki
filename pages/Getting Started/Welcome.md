This is your personal, Markdown-powered wiki. Everything you see here is a static Markdown file.

## How to Get Started

1.  **Add a new page:** Create a new `.md` file in the `/pages` directory.
2.  **Add a category:** Create a new folder inside `/pages`.
3.  **Register your content:** Update the `pages/index.json` file to include your new categories and pages.
4.  **Write content:** Use Markdown syntax to format your text. You can create headings, lists, links, and more.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. It's designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats.

-   **Bold:** `**Bold Text**`
-   *Italic:* `*Italic Text*`
-   `Code:` ``` `Code Block` ```
