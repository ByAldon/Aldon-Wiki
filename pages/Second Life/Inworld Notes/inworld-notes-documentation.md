**Note: Variations from the Original**

The images in this documentation are intended for illustration purposes 
and may differ from the original product or situation. While I strive to
 provide an accurate representation, colors, sizes, and other visual 
elements may vary based on factors such as lighting, screen settings, 
camera settings, and the viewer used. I recommend consulting the 
original product or situation for the most accurate information.

**Add more text to your note**<br>
Due to the 255-character limit per entry in the menu, we've created a solution to add more content.
You can click a button to add additional content. Choose '**Yes**' to continue or '**No**' to finish the note.<br>

**Read your notes**<br>
When you click on 'Read note', the note will be displayed in your nearby chat.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Readnoteinnearbychat.jpg" /><br>
As you can see, it has logged the date and time. This way, you can tell when this note was created.<br>
**Please remember that the time is based on SLT.**

**Add Notes**<br>
Currently, it is not possible to edit notes, so I had to create an 'Add a note' option instead. To do this, simply click '**Add note**' in the menu.
This will open a dialog where you can enter your addition. Again, the maximum is 255 characters per entry.

After you click '**Submit**', a dialog will appear asking if you want to add any additional notes to your existing note.<br>
