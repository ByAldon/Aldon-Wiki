The images in this documentation are intended for illustration purposes 
and may differ from the original product or situation. While I strive to
 provide an accurate representation, colors, sizes, and other visual 
elements may vary based on factors such as lighting, screen settings, 
camera settings, and the viewer used. I recommend consulting the 
original product or situation for the most accurate information.

### Adding a Note

To add a Note simply Click on the HUD.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Hud.jpg" />

Click on "Add note" in the menu.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Themenudialog-addnote.jpg" />

**Note Title**<br>
Now you can enter the title of your note.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Enter_the_title_of_your_note.jpg" />

**Note Content**<br>
After you have pressed '**Submit**', you can enter your content.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Enterthecontent.jpg" />

**Add more text to your note**<br>
Due to the 255-character limit per entry in the menu, we've created a solution to add more content.
You can click a button to add additional content. Choose '**Yes**' to continue or '**No**' to finish the note.<br>

### Reading your notes

To read your Note simply Click on the HUD<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Hud.jpg" />

Click on "Notes" in the menu<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Themenudialog-gotonotes.jpg" />

**Notes list**<br>
In this section you will be able to find your notes.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Noteslist.jpg" />

**Edit your notes**<br>
Click on one of your notes, and you will be able to either '**Read**', '**Add note**', or '**Delete note**'.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Examplenote.jpg" />

**Read your notes**<br>
When you click on 'Read note', the note will be displayed in your nearby chat.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Readnoteinnearbychat.jpg" /><br>
As you can see, it has logged the date and time. This way, you can tell when this note was created.<br>
**Please remember that the time is based on SLT.**

**Add Notes**<br>
Currently, it is not possible to edit notes, so I had to create an 'Add a note' option instead. To do this, simply click '**Add note**' in the menu.
This will open a dialog where you can enter your addition. Again, the maximum is 255 characters per entry.
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Addadditionalnotes.jpg" /><br>

After you click '**Submit**', a dialog will appear asking if you want to add any additional notes to your existing note.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Addmoretexttoadditionalnotes.jpg" />

If you added more notes, you can review them by clicking 'Read note' again.
You will then be able to see the additional notes along with the date and time.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Nearbychatextranotesadded3.jpg" />

**Delete a note**<br>
Don't need this note anymore? Just click the delete button!
You will see a verification dialog asking if you really want to proceed.<br>

### Options

To access the options, click on the HUD.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Hud.jpg" />

Click on 'Options' in the menu.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Clickonoptionsinthemenu.jpg" />

You will have the following buttons at your disposal:
'DELETE ALL', 'Export', 'Docs' and 'About'.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Theoptionsdialog.jpg" />

**DELETE ALL**<br>
When you click 'DELETE ALL', you will remove ALL notes!
But don't worry, as there is built-in security for this. First, you need to agree to actually remove all the files:<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Verificationtodeleteallnotesyesorno.jpg" />

Then you are required to type 'DELETE' before you can proceed.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Typedeletetoconfirm.jpg" />

After you have done this, the script will perform a hard reset, which will generate a new user ID.  
So, **be careful when using this feature!** After this, it will no longer be possible to recover your data.

(Make sure to use the [export feature](#) so you don't lose your data).

**Export**<br>
With the export feature, you can export all notes to your email.
This can be useful if you have many notes and don't want to clutter your nearby chat with text.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Exporttroughemail.jpg" />

After you have entered your email address, the menu will prompt you for verification.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Exportyournotestoemailhitsend.jpg" />

It takes a few seconds for the system to process the email. Once it is processed, you will receive a notification in the dialog.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\Exportyournotestoemailhitsend.jpg" />

The exported notes to email will look something like this.<br>
<img src="assets\secondlife\inworldnotes\docs\The_exported_notes_to_email_will_look_something_like_this..jpg" width="600" />

**Docs**<br>
The 'Docs' button provides a link to this documentation page, ensuring you can always find it.<br>
