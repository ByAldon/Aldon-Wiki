## Roadmap

This is the roadmap for future updates.<br>*Please remember that not every plan will make it to the final product!*

- **Improving the appearance of the email template.**

- **Make it possible to resize the HUD**

- **Edit your notes**<br>Currently, **editing** your notes is not possible. I am working hard to add this feature.

- **Pick a date and time on your notes as a future reminder**<br>You can select a date and time for your specific notes to set a reminder for the future, so you won't forget about the note you made.

- **Export your notes in other ways.**<br>Wanting to give the user the ability to export in other ways, such as to OneDrive or Google Drive.<br>Help us brainstorm about this in our [forum](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/jolt/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3). However, the question is whether there is interest in this.
